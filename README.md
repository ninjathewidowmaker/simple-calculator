This is my first post here just a simple useless calculator with a CFF(click for fun) button which has no particular use.
Although you can perform simple two variable calculations but you can't perform complicated calculations, and I copied this from a random youtube channel but CFF button was my personal idea.
But in future I may get bored and some features like actual use of CFF button and some funny error messages instead of good ol NaN.
Well that's it.
